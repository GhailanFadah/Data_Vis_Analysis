            into KNN at which we are determining the predicted class. Think of this as regularly
            spaced 2D "fake data" that we generate and plug into KNN and get predictions at.

        TODO:
        - Pick a discrete/qualitative color scheme. We suggest, like in the clustering project, to
        use a ColorBrewer color palette. List of possible ones here:
        https://github.com/CartoDB/CartoColor/wiki/CARTOColor-Scheme-Names
            - An example: cartocolors.qualitative.Safe_4.mpl_colors
            - The 4 stands for the number of colors in the palette. For simplicity, you can assume
            that we're hard coding this at 4 for 4 classes.
        - Each ColorBrewer palette is a Python list. Wrap this in a `ListedColormap` object so that
        matplotlib can parse it (already imported above).
        - Make an ndarray of length `n_sample_pts` of regularly spaced points between -40 and +40.
        - Call `np.meshgrid` on your sampling vector to get the x and y coordinates of your 2D
        "fake data" sample points in the square region from [-40, 40] to [40, 40].
            - Example: x, y = np.meshgrid(samp_vec, samp_vec)
        - Combine your `x` and `y` sample coordinates into a single ndarray and reshape it so that
        you can plug it in as your `data` in self.predict.
            - Shape of `x` should be (n_sample_pts, n_sample_pts). You want to make your input to
            self.predict of shape=(n_sample_pts*n_sample_pts, 2).
        - Reshape the predicted classes (`y_pred`) in a square grid format for plotting in 2D.
        shape=(n_sample_pts, n_sample_pts).
        - Use the `plt.pcolormesh` function to create your plot. Use the `cmap` optional parameter
        to specify your discrete ColorBrewer color palette.
        - Add a colorbar to your plot
