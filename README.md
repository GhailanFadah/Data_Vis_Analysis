contains the projects for data visualization and analysis course at Colby college. Big data files have been omitted and should be obtained locally.

# Project 1: mini-pandas
created a file reader class for csv files with sophisticated methods comparable to the pandas module. Additionally built an analysis class that performs simple statistical computations built from scratch and plot functions such as pair plots. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris
