contains the projects for data visualization and analysis course at Colby college. Big data files have been omitted and should be obtained locally.

# Project 1: mini-pandas
created a file reader class for csv files with sophisticated methods comparable to the pandas module. Additionally built an analysis class that performs simple statistical computations built from scratch and plot functions such as pair plots. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris

# Project 2: matrix-transformations
used the previous project and built matrix transformation capabilities such as scaling, rotation, and translation. Used that inorder to explore normalization techniques.

# Project 3: regression models
Built both a linear and a poly regression model from scratch and used it to analyze the iris dataset as well as improve my pair plot function.

# Project 4: PCA 
explored the concept of principal component analysis by building a model from scratch and used it to perform the eigenface algorithm on human faces as well as an early idea for facial recognition. Dataset: https://conradsanderson.id.au/lfwcrop/
